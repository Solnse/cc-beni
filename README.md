CC Beni
=======

In our world of credit offers and benefits with complicated and misleading terms and qualifications,
how do you know you are maximizing your bonus potential from today's multitude of cash-back offers,
points programs, amd mileage earnings?

Credit cards are accepted almost anywhere for almost anything you purchase. From everyday spending
for gas and groceries to purchasing that next computer or putting a down-payment on that used car,
you can maximize your return on these purchases by taking advantages of bonus offers from credit card
companies in today's financial landscape.

How do you know which offer is going to give you the best return for your purchasing power on each
and every purchase?

Credit Card Beni is here to help. CC Beni will analyze all your current credit card offers and tell you
which company is offering you the best return for your purchase.

Tell CC Beni your goals and you will have your own guardian angel beside you before you spend every dollar.


For Example
------------
The average American drives 15,000 miles a year. For a car that gets about 20 mpg, that means you are putting
$2625.00 a year in your gas tank. Using a credit card that offers you 5% cash back on your gas purchases
means you will receive over $131 back by simply choosing the right *way* to spend your money.

If you are looking for that new computer, many points programs will let you earn points throughout the year
on your daily purchases and you may find that at the end of the year you've earned enough bonus points to
make the credit company buy that computer for you!

Know your buying power
